# dcgan-model
this model is for generating the fake images using the real images of humans


Introduction:This model is made for generating the images similar to the real data images. it uses the deep learning algorithm called Generative Adverserial Network(GAN). In which it has two network i.e generator and discriminator
The role of the Generator is to generate a images using random nosie as number in form of vectors and try to mimics with the real images datasets from input .
next the Discriminator is to distniguish between real and fake images using classification method i.e if a image is real it will deonte as 1 and if the image is fake then it denote as 0.

Installation: Clone the repository:



## Usage

To generate images using the pre-trained model:

1. Run the following command:



Results:The model has been trained on the CelebA dataset, and it can generate a decent  images of celebrity faces. Here are some examples of generated images: see in the generative-ai.jpg
